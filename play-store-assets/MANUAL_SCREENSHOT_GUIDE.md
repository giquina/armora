## üÜò TROUBLESHOOTING

**Problem:** App not loading at localhost:3000
**Solution:** Run `npm start` in terminal and wait for "Compiled successfully!"

**Problem:** DevTools device emulation not available
**Solution:** Update Chrome to latest version. Emulation requires Chrome 70+

**Problem:** Screenshots are wrong dimensions
**Solution:**
- Make sure DPR is set to 2.0 in DevTools
- Use "Capture full size screenshot" not regular screenshot
- Check custom dimensions are exactly 1080x1920

**Problem:** Can't navigate to certain views
**Solution:**
- Try manually typing URL: `http://localhost:3000/?view=account`
- Some views may require authentication - use guest mode or login first

**Problem:** Map not loading in screenshot 4
**Solution:**
- Check Google Maps API key is configured
- Wait 5-10 seconds for tiles to load
- May need active internet connection
