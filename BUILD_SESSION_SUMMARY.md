**Issues Resolved**:
1. ❌ **Build failure**: Missing node_modules in build job

## Lessons Learned

### GitHub Actions Workflow Design
**Issue**: Two-job workflow caused dependency issues
**Solution**: Single-job workflow maintains state throughout build
**Takeaway**: Keep related build steps in same job when dependencies exist

### Android SDK Versioning
**Issue**: Capacitor 7 requires API 35 features
**Solution**: Update all SDK versions together
**Takeaway**: Always check framework requirements before starting build

### Java Version Requirements
**Issue**: Capacitor 7 uses Java 21 language features
**Solution**: Update both workflow and local environment to Java 21
**Takeaway**: Modern frameworks require modern tooling

### File Ignore Patterns
**Issue**: .gitignore blocked gradle.properties
**Solution**: Force-add critical configuration files
**Takeaway**: Some config files should be in version control

## Conclusion

The Armora Security Transport Android app is now **fully built, signed, and ready for Google Play Store internal testing**. The only remaining blocker is the phone number verification requirement, which is a 5-minute manual step in the Play Console.

Once phone verification is complete, the app can be immediately rolled out to internal testers, with production release possible within 3-10 days depending on testing duration and Google's review time.

All automated build infrastructure is in place and working reliably, making future updates quick and easy.

**Overall Status**: 🎉 **SUCCESS** - Production-ready AAB delivered!
