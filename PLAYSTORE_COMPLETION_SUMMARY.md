## ⚠️ Important Reminders

1. **Firebase App ID**: This is the ONLY missing credential. Everything else is ready.

2. **Screenshots**: Required by Play Store. Can't submit without them.

3. **Play Store Signing**: After upload, add the Play Store signing fingerprint to `assetlinks.json`

4. **Testing**: Always test the internal track version before production release

5. **Version Management**:
   - Current: v1.0.0 (code 1)
   - Update in `package.json` and `twa-manifest.json` for future releases

6. **Digital Asset Links**: Critical for removing URL bar
   - Must have correct SHA-256 fingerprint
   - Must be accessible at: `https://armora.vercel.app/.well-known/assetlinks.json`
   - Must include BOTH local keystore AND Play Store signing fingerprints
