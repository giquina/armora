- ‚ùå Chauffeur service (unless specifically licensed)
- ‚ùå Transportation company

## üìã OFFICIAL SERVICE DEFINITION

### Secure Transport & Close Protection (Armora Legal Definition)

Armora does not provide standard "chauffeuring" or private hire taxi services. Instead, the platform coordinates **SIA-licensed Close Protection Officers (CPOs)** who additionally provide **secure transport** as part of their protective duties.

This service is defined as:

1. **Close Protection with Secure Transport**
   The safe conveyance of clients in vehicles by licensed operatives trained in both **protective security** and **professional driving standards**.

2. **Executive Protection Driving**
   Transport integrated with risk management, route planning, and client safety, going beyond the scope of private hire.

3. **Protective Mobility**
   Enabling clients to move securely between locations under the supervision of licensed Close Protection personnel.

This distinction ensures Armora is correctly aligned with **SIA regulatory categories** (Close Protection) rather than private hire operator regulations. The transport function is always delivered **as an integrated element of Close Protection**, not as a stand-alone chauffeuring service.

## ‚öñÔ∏è LEGAL & REGULATORY NOTES

### Why This Matters
1. **Regulatory Compliance:** Using taxi terminology could trigger PHV licensing requirements
2. **Insurance Validity:** Our insurance covers close protection, not taxi services
3. **Legal Classification:** Misrepresentation could result in:
   - ¬£5,000+ regulatory fines
   - Insurance claim denials
   - License revocation
   - Legal liability

### Key Distinctions

| Close Protection (Our Service) | PHV/Taxi (Not Our Service) |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| SIA licensed | Local authority licensed |
| Security focus | Transport focus |
| Protection officers | Drivers |
| Threat assessment | Route optimization |
| Principal safety | Passenger convenience |
| Security protocols | Transport efficiency |
