## Important Notes

### App Signing Key Management
⚠️ **Critical**: The armora-release-key.jks file must be kept secure and backed up. Loss of this key means you cannot update the app.

**Keystore Backup Locations**:
- Local: `/workspaces/armora/armora-release-key.jks`
- Secure storage: [Add your secure backup location]

### Google Play App Signing
Google will create a separate upload key during first release. This allows Google to manage the app signing key, providing additional security.

### Version Management
For future updates:
- Increment versionCode in `android/app/build.gradle`
- Update versionName for user-visible version
- Maintain backwards compatibility
- Test thoroughly before release
