## 🚨 TOP 3 CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES

### 1. **[PRODUCTION BLOCKER] Implement QuestionnaireFlow Component**
```bash
Current: Placeholder stub | Target: Fully functional 9-step questionnaire
Status: COMPONENT EXISTS but NOT IMPORTED/USED in App.tsx
```
**Why Critical**: Core business logic missing - questionnaire is the main value proposition  
**Business Impact**: 🔥🔥🔥 Users can't complete onboarding, no personalization, no bookings  
**Effort**: 2-3 hours | **ROI**: Massive - enables the entire user journey  
**Files**: App.tsx (uncomment import), QuestionnaireFlow.tsx (verify functionality)  
**Action**: Import existing QuestionnaireFlow component and connect to routing

### 2. **[REVENUE BLOCKER] Implement Booking Flow System**  
```bash
Current: Empty placeholder | Target: Complete booking flow with vehicle selection
Status: Basic stub exists, needs full implementation
```
**Why Critical**: Users can't actually book rides - core revenue functionality missing  
**Business Impact**: 🔥🔥🔥 Zero revenue generation, app is just a demo  
**Effort**: 6-8 hours | **ROI**: Enables revenue - most critical business feature  
**Components Needed**: VehicleSelection, LocationPicker, BookingConfirmation  
**Action**: Build complete booking flow from scratch

### 3. **[USER EXPERIENCE] Complete Achievement System Integration**
```bash
Current: Placeholder stub | Target: Fully animated achievement unlock
Status: AchievementUnlock component exists but not imported/used
```
**Why Critical**: Missing gamification reduces conversion and engagement  
**Business Impact**: 🔥🔥 50% off reward is key conversion driver  
**Effort**: 1-2 hours | **ROI**: High engagement, better conversion rates  
**Files**: App.tsx (uncomment import), verify AchievementUnlock component  
**Action**: Import existing AchievementUnlock and connect to user journey

## 🔥 HIGH-IMPACT IMPLEMENTATION TASKS

### 4. **[TESTING] Add Comprehensive Test Suite**
**Why**: Only 1 test file for entire application  
**Impact**: 🔥🔥🔥 Critical for production deployment  
**Effort**: 6-8 hours  
**Priority**: Authentication flow, Dashboard, QuestionnaireFlow  
**Action**: Add React Testing Library tests for core user journeys

### 5. **[PWA] Complete Service Worker Implementation**  
**Why**: Partial PWA setup (manifest exists, no service worker)  
**Impact**: 🔥🔥 Mobile users expect offline functionality  
**Effort**: 3-4 hours  
**Files**: Add service-worker.js, update public/index.html  
**Action**: Enable caching, offline quotes, push notifications

### 6. **[SECURITY] Add Error Boundaries**
**Why**: No error handling - app crashes propagate to users  
**Impact**: 🔥🔥 Professional UX, prevents user frustration  
**Effort**: 2-3 hours  
**Files**: App.tsx (global boundary), async components  
**Action**: Wrap routes in ErrorBoundary components with fallback UIs
