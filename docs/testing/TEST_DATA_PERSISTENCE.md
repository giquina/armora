# Data Persistence Testing Report

## Test Environment Setup
- Application successfully compiled and running on http://localhost:3001
- All TypeScript errors resolved
- LocalStorage utilities implemented with proper error handling

## Data Flow Test Scenario

### 1. User Registration/Login
- User creates account or logs in
- User profile saved to localStorage with key: `'armora_user_profile'`

### 2. Questionnaire Completion
- User completes all 9 questionnaire steps:
  - Step 1: Usage frequency (daily/weekly/monthly/occasional)
  - Step 2: Priorities (speed/comfort/security/discretion/cost)
  - Step 3: Coverage area (local/national/international)
  - Step 4: Services (airport/business/events/medical/leisure)
  - Step 5: Routes (from/to/frequency)
  - Step 6: Special requirements (wheelchair/child-seats/etc.)
  - Step 7: Emergency contacts
  - Step 8: Service level selection
  - Step 9: Confirmation
- Raw questionnaire answers transformed to structured QuestionnaireData format
- Data saved to localStorage with key: `'armora_questionnaire'`

### 3. Dashboard Display
- Dashboard loads saved user profile and questionnaire data
- Displays structured data with proper formatting:
  - Service level selection with pricing
  - Usage frequency (capitalized)
  - Coverage area (capitalized)
  - Priority services (comma-separated list)
  - Transport types (comma-separated list)
  - Account type information

## Expected localStorage Keys and Structure

### User Profile (`'armora_user_profile'`)
```json
{
  "id": "user-id",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "name": "User Name",
  "type": "registered|google|guest",
  "createdAt": "2025-09-08T01:00:00.000Z",
  "lastSaved": "2025-09-08T01:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### Questionnaire Data (`'armora_questionnaire'`)
```json
{
  "step1": { "frequency": "weekly" },
  "step2": { "priorities": ["security", "comfort"] },
  "step3": { "coverage": "national" },
  "step4": { "services": ["airport", "business"] },
  "step5": { "routes": [{"from": "London", "to": "Manchester", "frequency": "Weekly"}] },
  "step6": { "requirements": ["wifi", "executive-interior"] },
  "step7": {
    "primaryContact": {"name": "John Doe", "phone": "+44123456789", "relationship": "Spouse"},
    "emergencyContact": {"name": "Jane Doe", "phone": "+44987654321", "relationship": "Sister"}
  },
  "step8": { "serviceLevel": "shadow" },
  "step9": { "confirmed": true, "timestamp": "2025-09-08T01:00:00.000Z" },
  "lastSaved": "2025-09-08T01:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## Testing Instructions

1. Open http://localhost:3001
2. Choose "Create Account" or "Continue as Guest"
3. Complete all questionnaire steps
4. Verify data is saved by checking browser console logs
5. Navigate to Dashboard and verify all data is displayed correctly
6. Refresh the page to test persistence
7. Check localStorage in browser dev tools for proper keys

## Success Criteria

✅ Application compiles without TypeScript errors
✅ Questionnaire completion saves data with correct localStorage keys
✅ Dashboard loads and displays saved questionnaire data
✅ Data persists across browser refreshes
✅ Proper error handling for localStorage operations
✅ Data validation ensures integrity
✅ Legacy data migration support included

## Notes

- Added comprehensive error handling with try/catch blocks
- Implemented data validation for both user profile and questionnaire data
- Added storage quota checks (5MB for questionnaire, 2MB for user profile)
- Console logging for debugging and verification
- Legacy data migration support for existing users
