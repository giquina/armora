## Common Questions

### Q: Why is the app categorized as "Business"?
**A:** Armora provides professional security services primarily for corporate executives, business travelers, and professional use cases. While it has lifestyle applications, the primary user base and use cases are business-oriented.

### Q: Why PEGI 3 / Everyone rating?
**A:** The app contains no violent, sexual, or inappropriate content. It's a professional security services platform with standard business functionality. The "Everyone" rating is appropriate.

### Q: What about in-app purchases?
**A:** Armora uses Stripe for payment processing, which is external to Google Play. There are no Google Play in-app purchases or subscriptions. Users pay for services directly through Stripe's secure payment gateway.

### Q: Why request location permissions?
**A:** Location is essential for:
1. Matching users with nearest available CPO
2. Real-time tracking during protection details
3. Regional pricing determination
All location data is deleted 24 hours after service completion per privacy policy.

### Q: What about the "Client Vehicle" tier?
**A:** This tier provides professional security drivers who operate the client's personal vehicle. It's still a security service (SIA-licensed CPO acting as security driver), not a transportation service. The client owns and insures the vehicle.
