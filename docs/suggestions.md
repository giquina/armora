## 🔥 REMAINING WORK (3% - ~8 hours)

### 1. Firebase Messaging Service Worker 🔥🔥
**Status:** MISSING
**File:** `/public/firebase-messaging-sw.js`
**Impact:** HIGH - No push notifications when app is in background/closed
**Effort:** 1-2 hours

**What's needed:**
```javascript
// Create /public/firebase-messaging-sw.js
importScripts('https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/10.x.x/firebase-app-compat.js');
importScripts('https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/10.x.x/firebase-messaging-compat.js');

firebase.initializeApp({
  apiKey: "AIzaSyCByrZaVECC1n3mebfrRqEHdLxjAO86TEU",
  projectId: "armora-protection",
  messagingSenderId: "1010601153585",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
});

const messaging = firebase.messaging();

messaging.onBackgroundMessage((payload) => {
  // Handle background notifications
});
```

**Why it's important:**
- Users need real-time notifications when CPO arrives
- Assignment updates when app is closed
- Emergency alerts for protection details

### 2. Android AAB File Rebuild 🔥🔥🔥
**Status:** MISSING (File not found in repository)
**Impact:** CRITICAL - Cannot submit to Google Play Store
**Effort:** 2-3 hours

**What's needed:**
```bash
# Install Bubblewrap CLI
npm install -g @bubblewrap/cli

# Initialize TWA project
bubblewrap init --manifest https://armora.vercel.app/manifest.json

# Update configuration
bubblewrap update

# Build AAB and APK
bubblewrap build
```

**Required files:**
- `android.keystore` (signing key)
- `app-release-bundle.aab` (Play Store upload)
- `app-release.apk` (testing)

**Keystore Info:**

---

### 3. Google Play Store Publication 🔥🔥🔥
**Status:** BLOCKED (Waiting on Google verification + AAB file)
**Impact:** CRITICAL - Cannot distribute to public
**Effort:** 2-4 hours (after verification)

**Steps remaining:**
1. ✅ Developer account created
2. ⏳ Awaiting Google verification (external dependency)
3. ❌ Upload AAB file (blocked by #2)
4. ❌ Add screenshots (4-8 required)

### 4. Optional Enhancements (Low Priority)

#### A. Service Worker for PWA (Production Only) 🔥
**Status:** Disabled in development (intentional)
**Impact:** LOW - Improves offline experience
**Effort:** 1-2 hours

**Note:** Service worker is currently disabled in development to prevent caching issues. Only enable for production PWA features.

#### B. Test Coverage Expansion 🔥
**Status:** Basic E2E tests exist
**Impact:** MEDIUM - Improves reliability
**Effort:** 4-6 hours

**Areas to expand:**
- Payment flow E2E tests
