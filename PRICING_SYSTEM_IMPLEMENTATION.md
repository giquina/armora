## Pricing Logic

### Base Calculation
```typescript
// Protection hours (minimum 2 hours)
const journeyHours = (timeNeeded * 2) / 60; // Both ways
const protectionHours = Math.max(journeyHours + 0.5, 2);

// Costs
const protectionOfficerCost = protectionHours * serviceRate;
const secureVehicleCost = distance * vehicleRate;
const subtotal = protectionOfficerCost + secureVehicleCost;
```

### Member Discounts
```typescript
// 20% discount for registered members
const memberDiscount = isMember ? subtotal * 0.2 : 0;
const memberPrice = subtotal - memberDiscount;
const savings = memberDiscount;
```

### Journey Time Estimation
Based on destination analysis:
- **Airports**: 45 minutes
- **Central London**: 30 minutes
- **Shopping centers**: 20 minutes
- **Default**: 25 minutes

### Distance Estimation
