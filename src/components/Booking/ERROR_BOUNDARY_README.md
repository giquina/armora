# Booking Error Boundary Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds comprehensive error boundaries to all booking flow components to prevent crashes during the booking process and ensure revenue protection.

## Components Added

### 1. BookingErrorBoundary.tsx
A React Error Boundary component with the following features:
- **Retry functionality**: Users can retry up to 3 times
- **State preservation**: Booking state is preserved during errors
- **Fallback UI**: Professional error display with recovery options
- **Support integration**: Direct email to support with error details
- **Development mode**: Shows detailed error information for debugging

### 2. ErrorBoundaryTest.tsx
A development-only component that allows testing error boundaries by triggering intentional errors.

## Implementation Details

### Error Boundary Features
- **Maximum Retries**: 3 attempts before suggesting alternative actions
- **State Preservation**: Booking data saved to localStorage with 30-minute expiration
- **Error Logging**: Comprehensive error logging for production monitoring
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear explanations and recovery options
- **Contact Support**: Pre-filled email with error details

### Wrapped Components
All booking flow components are wrapped with error boundaries:
- `VehicleSelection` - Service selection step
- `LocationPicker` - Pickup/destination input
- `BookingConfirmation` - Final booking confirmation

### State Management
The error boundary system includes:
- **Preserved State**: Service selection, booking data, and progress
- **Recovery Logic**: Automatic state restoration on retry
- **Cleanup**: State cleared after successful booking completion
- **Expiration**: 30-minute timeout for preserved state

## Usage

### Wrapping Components
```tsx
<BookingErrorBoundary
  fallbackComponent="vehicle-selection"
  onRetry={handleErrorRetry}
  onNavigateBack={handleErrorNavigateBack}
  preservedState={getPreservedState()}
>
  <VehicleSelection />
</BookingErrorBoundary>
```

### Testing Errors (Development Only)
The `ErrorBoundaryTest` component appears in development mode and allows triggering test errors to verify error boundary functionality.

## Error Recovery Flow

1. **Error Occurs**: Component throws unhandled error
2. **Error Boundary Catches**: BookingErrorBoundary intercepts error
3. **State Preservation**: Current booking state saved to localStorage
4. **Fallback UI Shown**: User sees error message with options
5. **User Actions Available**:
   - Retry (up to 3 times)
   - Navigate back to previous step
   - Contact support
6. **State Recovery**: On retry, preserved state is restored

## Files Modified

### New Files Created
- `/src/components/Booking/BookingErrorBoundary.tsx` - Main error boundary component
- `/src/components/Booking/BookingErrorBoundary.module.css` - Error boundary styles
- `/src/components/Booking/ErrorBoundaryTest.tsx` - Development testing component

### Modified Files
- `/src/App.tsx` - Updated BookingFlow to wrap components with error boundaries
- `/src/components/Booking/index.ts` - Added BookingErrorBoundary export

## Benefits

### Revenue Protection
- **Prevents Lost Bookings**: Users can recover from errors without losing progress
- **State Preservation**: Service selection and location data maintained during errors
- **Multiple Recovery Options**: Retry, navigate back, or contact support

### User Experience
- **Professional Error Handling**: Clean, branded error messages
- **Clear Recovery Path**: Users understand how to proceed after errors
- **Support Integration**: Direct path to get help when needed

### Development Benefits
- **Error Visibility**: Comprehensive error logging and reporting
- **Easy Testing**: Built-in error simulation for development
- **Maintainable Code**: Centralized error handling logic

## Error Logging

### Development Mode
- Full error details in console
- Component stack traces
- Error boundary activation details

### Production Mode
- Error message and basic details
- Component identification
- Timestamp and user context
- Ready for integration with error monitoring services (Sentry, LogRocket, etc.)

## Testing the Implementation

1. **Start Development Server**: `npm start`
2. **Navigate to Booking Flow**: Go through the app to booking
3. **Trigger Test Error**: Click the red "Test Error Boundary" button (development only)
4. **Verify Error Boundary**: Should see professional error UI
5. **Test Recovery**: Try retry functionality and state preservation

## Production Considerations

- Error details are hidden from users in production
- Error logs are sent to console (ready for external service integration)
- Support contact information should be updated for production
- Consider adding analytics tracking for error occurrences

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with error monitoring services
- User feedback collection on errors
- Analytics tracking for error patterns
- A/B testing of error recovery flows
- Offline error handling for PWA features
