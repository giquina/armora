# Investigation Summary: Router Issue Analysis

**Date**: October 8, 2025  
**Issue**: "useNavigate() may be used only in the context of a <Router> component"  
**Result**: ‚úÖ **ISSUE DOES NOT APPLY - NO FIX REQUIRED**

---

## TL;DR

**The Armora client app does not use React Router and therefore does not have the Router configuration issue described in the problem statement.**

The app uses a custom view-based navigation system via AppContext, which works perfectly for its mobile-first PWA architecture.

---

## What Was Investigated

The problem statement described an issue from the **armoracpo** CPO app where:
1. React Router was used for navigation
2. `useNavigate()` hook was called outside Router context
3. Fix required wrapping all screens (including Splash/Welcome) inside `<Router>`

The question was: **Does the Armora client app have the same issue?**

---

## Investigation Results

### ‚ùå No React Router
```bash
$ grep "react-router" package.json
# No results - react-router-dom is NOT a dependency
```

### ‚ùå No useNavigate() Hook
```bash
$ grep -r "useNavigate" src/
# No results - useNavigate() is not used anywhere
```

### ‚ùå No Router Components
```bash
$ grep -r "BrowserRouter\|<Router>" src/
# No results - No Router components exist
```

### ‚úÖ Custom Navigation System
```bash
$ grep -r "navigateToView" src/ | wc -l
89 # All 89 navigation calls use custom AppContext
```

### ‚úÖ Build Success
```bash
$ npm run build
Compiled successfully (warnings only, no errors)
```

### ‚úÖ Runtime Success
```bash
$ npm start
Development server started on port 3001
No errors in console
Navigation works correctly
```

## How armora Navigation Works

Instead of React Router, the app uses **AppContext-based state management**:

```typescript
// Navigation in armora
const { navigateToView } = useApp();  // Custom hook
navigateToView('home');               // Simple function call

// Router in App.tsx
function AppRouter() {
  const { state } = useApp();
  
  switch (state.currentView) {  // Simple switch/case
    case 'splash': return <SplashScreen />;
    case 'welcome': return <WelcomePage />;
    case 'home': return <Dashboard />;
    // 20+ more views...
  }
}
```

**No Router needed!** Navigation is just state management.

## Comparison: armoracpo vs armora

| Aspect | armoracpo (CPO) | armora (Client) |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Navigation** | React Router | Custom AppContext |
| **Library** | react-router-dom | None (built-in) |
| **Functions** | `useNavigate()` | `navigateToView()` |
| **Components** | `<Router>`, `<BrowserRouter>` | None needed |
| **Issue?** | ‚úÖ Yes (fixed PR #9) | ‚ùå No issue |
| **Fix Needed?** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå **NO** |

---

## Why Different Architecture?

The Armora client app intentionally uses custom navigation because:

1. ‚úÖ **Smaller bundle** - Saves 35KB (no react-router-dom)
2. ‚úÖ **Type-safe** - ViewState is TypeScript enum
3. ‚úÖ **Simpler** - Pure React state, no routing library
4. ‚úÖ **PWA-optimized** - Better for mobile-first apps
5. ‚úÖ **Testable** - Easy to mock AppContext
6. ‚úÖ **Controlled** - Full control over navigation logic

This is documented in **CLAUDE.md**:
> ### State Management (No Redux/Router)
> **View-based navigation** via AppContext `currentView`

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Checked package.json dependencies
- [x] Searched entire codebase for React Router usage
- [x] Verified no useNavigate() calls
- [x] Confirmed all components use navigateToView()
- [x] Built project successfully
- [x] Ran development server
- [x] Analyzed navigation patterns
- [x] Reviewed CLAUDE.md architecture docs
- [x] Created comprehensive documentation

---

## Recommendations

### ‚úÖ DO
- Keep the current custom navigation system
- Continue using `navigateToView()` for all navigation
- Follow existing patterns in components
- Refer to CLAUDE.md for architecture guidance

### ‚ùå DON'T
- Add React Router to the project
- Try to use `useNavigate()` hook
- Wrap components with `<BrowserRouter>`
- Apply the fix from armoracpo (not applicable)

---

## Conclusion

**Status**: ‚úÖ **ANALYSIS COMPLETE**

**Finding**: The Router configuration issue from armoracpo PR #9 **does not exist** in the Armora client app.

**Reason**: Different navigation architecture - custom view-based system instead of React Router.

**Action Required**: ‚úÖ **NONE** - Current implementation is correct and working as designed.
