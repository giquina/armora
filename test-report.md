- [x] 94 media queries for mobile found
- [x] 271+ touch targets configured (44px minimum)
- [x] Font sizes 1.4rem+ for readability
- [ ] Manual testing at 320px width required

## Features Working
- [x] Development server running
- [x] React app loads successfully
- [ ] User registration (needs testing)
- [ ] User login (needs testing)
- [ ] View Protection Officers (no data)
- [ ] Book protection assignment (needs testing)
- [ ] View assignment status (needs testing)

## Issues Found

### 1. **CRITICAL: Terminology Violations**
- 460+ instances of forbidden taxi terminology
- Terms found: taxi, driver, passenger, ride, fare, trip, pickup, dropoff
- Major files affected: App.tsx, Dashboard.tsx, Booking components, questionnaireData.ts

### 2. **Database Empty**
- Protection Officers table has 0 records
- Protection Assignments table has 0 records
- Need to run populateDatabase.ts to seed data

### 3. **Test Suite Failures**
- Jest tests fail due to environment variables not loading
- 0% code coverage currently
- Need to configure test environment properly

### 4. **Missing Tables**
- 'users' table not found (using 'profiles' instead)
- 'vehicles' table not found in schema

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Fix Terminology** - Replace all taxi/driver references with protection service terms
2. **Populate Database** - Run `node src/utils/populateDatabase.ts`
3. **Fix Test Environment** - Configure Jest to load .env.local
4. **Manual Testing** - Open http://localhost:3000 in browser

### Commands to Fix Issues:

```bash
# 1. Populate database with sample data
node src/utils/populateDatabase.ts

# 2. Fix test environment
echo "REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=https://jmzvrqwjmlnvxojculee.supabase.co" > .env.test
echo "REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[your-key]" >> .env.test

# 3. Run terminology replacement (careful - backup first!)
# Would need custom script to replace terms systematically
```

## Performance Metrics
- Build time: ~45 seconds
- Bundle size: 327KB (gzipped)
- CSS: 158KB
- Lighthouse score: Not tested (manual check needed)

## Security Status
- [x] Environment variables configured
- [x] Supabase RLS enabled (per connection test)
- [x] No hardcoded credentials in source
- [ ] CORS configuration needs review

## Ready for Production?
**❌ NO - Critical issues need resolution:**
1. Terminology violations must be fixed
2. Database needs population
3. Test coverage needs improvement (currently 0%)
4. Manual browser testing required

## Recommendations
1. Create automated terminology replacement script
2. Set up database seeding in CI/CD pipeline
3. Fix Jest configuration for environment variables
4. Add E2E tests with Playwright
5. Implement pre-commit hooks for terminology checking
