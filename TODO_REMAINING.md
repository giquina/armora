## üöÄ QUICK START (Once Sentry DSN is added)

**After you give me the Sentry DSN, here's what happens**:

1. I add it to Vercel (30 seconds)
2. Vercel auto-redeploys (2-3 minutes)
3. App is fully monitored and ready
4. You can test everything works

**Then you can**:
- Test the app yourself
- OR send to Chrome Claude for automated testing
- OR both!

---

## üí° WHY SENTRY DSN IS THE ONLY BLOCKER

Everything else can be done **without** browser access:
- Testing scripts ‚úÖ (I'm creating now)
- Documentation ‚úÖ (Already complete)
- Deployment ‚úÖ (Already live)
- Code ‚úÖ (100% complete)

But Sentry DSN **requires** logging into sentry.io dashboard, which only you or Chrome Claude with browser can do.

---

## üìû NEXT STEPS

**For you right now**:
1. Login to https://sentry.io
2. Find your armoracpo project or create new "Armora Principal App"
3. Copy the DSN
4. Paste it here: "The DSN is: [paste here]"

**Then I will**:
1. Add it to Vercel immediately
2. Create all testing scripts
3. Verify everything works
4. Mark deployment as 100% complete

---

**Questions?** Just ask! But the DSN is the only thing blocking full completion.
